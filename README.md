# My Own Personal Operations Center: List of links for monitoring purposes

## Introduction

I like to have a second screen in which I have something to monitor, even better
if it's more than one thing. The idea behind this repo is to collect all
websites and tools that allow to monitor things, be those weather, security
intel, traffic, etc.

This README includes two parts: A categorized list of websites with monitorable
information, and browsers/browser tools that can be used, for instance, for
split views or multi-screen monitoring.

Pull requests are welcome. Share your favorite sources!

## Browsers and browser tools

### Browsers

* [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) has a
[tiling mode](https://vivalditips.com/efficiency/tab-tiling/en).

### Browser tools

NOTE: Keep in mind that Google Chrome extensions are also compatible with
Vivaldi.

#### Reloaders

Some pages don't have autorefresh mode or don't give live data. These tools
allow pages to be refreshed automatically in a certain amount of time.

* [Super Auto Refresh](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-auto-refresh/kkhjakkgopekjlempoplnjclgedabddk?hl=en-US)

#### Browser tilers

These give browsers tiling capabilities, so you can monitor multiple pages.

* [Tile Tabs WE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tile-tabs-we/lbnnfjfjdijcnaakaebgcoemmlicjbnl)

#### RSS readers

Any ideas here?
